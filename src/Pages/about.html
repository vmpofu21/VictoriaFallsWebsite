                        Meet <b>Vanessa</b> an enthusiastic globetrotter, she enjoys the freeadom and exposure that travelling brings her and the best part about travelling for her is the food.
                        Her travelling enthusiasm stemmed from growing up in a tourist town, Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Despite seeing the mighty Victoria Falls more than twice,
                        Vanessa is still captivated by the glory of the falls, and ever since then she's been travelling  every chance she gets.
                        Her travels extend beyond scenic vistas, delving into the heart of cuisine and cultures around the world. Vanessa is a UI/UX Designer at 
                        Paramount, and she's currently working on expanding her website to have useful information, mostly about the places she's been to. Exciting, right!!!<br>

                        <b>Fun fact: Vanessa has been to 4 of the World's Seven Natural Wonders; Victoria Falls(obvisously), Amazon Rainforest, Mount Everest and the Grand Canyon.</b>

                        a friendship grounded in shared passions for both adventure and intellectual curiosity. In the intervening years, Elsie and Vanessa have

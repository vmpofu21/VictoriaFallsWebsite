                <h2 id="headings">About Victoria Falls</h2>
                <p class="para1">Victoria Falls, known as "Mosi-oa-Tunya" (the Smoke that Thunders) by the locals, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site 
                    and one of the largest waterfalls in the world. Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe stands among the seven natural wonders of the world and is renowned as one of the most extraordinary waterfalls globally. 
                    Situated on the Zambezi River, bordering Zambia and Zimbabwe, this majestic waterfall spans a width of 1,708 meters and a height of 108 meters. 
                    The falls emit a spray that reaches a remarkable 400 meters above the descent, visible from distances of up to 30 kilometers. Local inhabitants aptly refer to Victoria Falls 
                    as the "Smoke that Thunders" due to the mist's smoke-like appearance, creating a spectacle enhanced by the resounding 
                    roar of the falls - a phenomenon one truly appreciates when experienced firsthand.

                <ul>
                    <li>Known locally as "Mosi-oa-Tunya," which means "The Smoke That Thunders," the name reflects the mist and the thunderous sound generated by the falls.</li>
                    <li>It is recognized as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, highlighting its exceptional beauty and significance.</li>
                    <li>Victoria Falls is the world's largest sheet of falling water.</li>
                    <li>The Scottish explorer and missionary, David Livingstone, was the first European to see Victoria Falls in 1855. He named the falls after Queen Victoria.</li>
                    <li>The Victoria Falls Bridge, built in 1905, connects Zambia and Zimbabwe and offers stunning views of the falls. It is a popular site for bungee jumping.</li>
                    <li>A lunar rainbow, or "moonbow," is a rare phenomenon visible at Victoria Falls during a full moon. The mist from the falls refracts the moonlight, creating a beautiful rainbow at night.</li>

                        <b id="headings-one">Best Time To Visit Victoria Falls.</b><br>
                        The best time to visit Victoria Falls is from February to May, 
                        directly after the summer rains, when you’ll see the world’s largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume. 
                        The tricky thing about visiting Victoria Falls is that the most impressive spray doesn’t coincide with peak safari season in nearby 
                        Chobe in Botswana or Hwange in Zimbabwe. Some activities, like swimming in Devil’s Pool and certain sections of white-water rapids, 
                        are also far too dangerous to undertake when the water is at its highest and fastest.
